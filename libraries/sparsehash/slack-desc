# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sparsehash: sparsehash (An extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation)
sparsehash:
sparsehash: An extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation. 2 bits/entry
sparsehash: overhead! The SparseHash library contains several hash-map
sparsehash: implementations, including implementations that optimize for space or
sparsehash: speed.
sparsehash:
sparsehash: These hashtable implementations are similar in API to SGI's hash_map
sparsehash: class and the tr1 unordered_map class, but with different performance
sparsehash: characteristics. It's easy to replace hash_map or unordered_map by
sparsehash: sparse_hash_map or dense_hash_map in C++ code.
