FreeBASIC: FreeBASIC
FreeBASIC:
FreeBASIC: FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural,
FreeBASIC: object-orientated and meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax
FreeBASIC: compatible to Microsoft QuickBASIC. In fact, the FreeBASIC project
FreeBASIC: originally began as an attempt to create a code-compatible, free
FreeBASIC: alternative to Microsoft QuickBASIC, but it has since grown into a
FreeBASIC: powerful development tool. FreeBASIC can be seen to extend the
FreeBASIC: capabilities of Microsoft QuickBASIC in a number of ways, supporting
FreeBASIC: more data types, language constructs, programming styles, and modern
FreeBASIC: platforms and APIs.
