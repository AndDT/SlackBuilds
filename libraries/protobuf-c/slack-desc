# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

protobuf-c: protobuf-c (a C implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers)
protobuf-c:
protobuf-c: This is a C implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers data
protobuf-c: serialization format. It includes `libprotobuf-c`, a pure C library
protobuf-c: that implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and `protoc-c`, a
protobuf-c: code generator that converts Protocol Buffer `.proto` files to C
protobuf-c: descriptor code, based on the original `protoc`. `protobuf-c`
protobuf-c: formerly included an RPC implementation; that code has been split out
protobuf-c: into the protobuf-c-rpc project.
protobuf-c: `protobuf-c` was originally written by Dave Benson and maintained by
protobuf-c: him through version 0.15 but is now being maintained by a new team.
