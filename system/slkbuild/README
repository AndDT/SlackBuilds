This is a utility to build packages for Slackware and derivatives
through the use of makepkg. slkbuild is a fork of buildpkg, which was
used in Zenwalk. The fork was needed to remove some features that are
specific to Zenwalk and add features that are not present there, like
support for the x86_64 architecture.

Please note root access is required. Use of fakeroot for running
slkbuild is advised. Read the man pages slkbuild(8) and SLKBUILD(5)
for more details on this tool.

 BE CAREFUL when adjusting build files as they could potentially harm your
 system if not done properly, especially when running as root!

Requirements: pkgtools, fakeroot(optional)
