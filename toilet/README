The TOIlet project attempts to create a free replacement for the ​FIGlet utility.
TOIlet stands for “The Other Implementation’s letters”, coined after FIGlet’s “Frank, Ian and Glen’s letters”.
TOIlet is in its very early development phase.
It uses the powerful libcaca library to achieve various text-based effects. 
TOIlet also aims for full FIGlet compatibility.
It is currently able to load FIGlet fonts and perform horizontal smushing.
