# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ecwolf: ecwolf (Advanced source port of Wolf3D and SoD based on Wolf4SDL)
ecwolf: 
ecwolf: ECWolf is an advanced source port for Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of
ecwolf: Destiny based off of the Wolf4SDL code base. ECWolf pulls a
ecwolf: substantial amount of code from ZDoom and aims to provide a wide
ecwolf: array of mod editing capabilities without the need to modify the
ecwolf: source code. Most importantly you will no longer need to replace
ecwolf: entire data sets. With ECWolf you could for example add a weapon
ecwolf: without needing to distribute every sprite in the game along with it.
ecwolf: Mods will be neatly packaged into a single file just like they are
ecwolf: for Doom.
