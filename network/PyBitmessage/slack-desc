PyBitmessage: pybitmessage (Send encrypted messages)
PyBitmessage:
PyBitmessage: Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send
PyBitmessage: encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It
PyBitmessage: is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not
PyBitmessage: inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities.
PyBitmessage: It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a
PyBitmessage: message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content"
PyBitmessage: data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive
PyBitmessage: eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping
PyBitmessage: programs.
