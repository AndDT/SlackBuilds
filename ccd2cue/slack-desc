# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ccd2cue: ccd2cue (a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter)
ccd2cue:
ccd2cue: GNU ccd2cue is a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter.  It supports the
ccd2cue: full extent of CUE sheet format expressiveness, including mixed-mode
ccd2cue: discs and CD-Text meta-data.  It plays an important role for those who
ccd2cue: need to use optical disc data which is only available in the
ccd2cue: proprietary sheet format CCD, but donâ€™t want to surrender their
ccd2cue: freedom. It fills an important gap in the free software world because
ccd2cue: before its conception it was impossible to use complex forms of
ccd2cue: optical disc data laid out by CCD sheets in a whole/holy free
ccd2cue: operating system.
