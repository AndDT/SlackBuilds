bitmessage: BitMessage (p2p program to send encrypted messages)
bitmessage:
bitmessage: Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted
bitmessage: messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is
bitmessage: decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently
bitmessage: trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses strong
bitmessage: authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot be
bitmessage: spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the sender and
bitmessage: receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running
bitmessage: warrantless wiretapping programs.
