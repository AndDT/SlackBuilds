Usermin is a web-based interface for webmail, password changing, mail filters,
fetchmail and much more. It is designed for use by regular non-root users on
a Unix system, and limits them to tasks that they would be able to perform if
logged in via SSH or at the console.

If you need to start usermin at boot.
The recommended way is to add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
script and make sure rc.usermin has executable permissions set:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.usermin ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.usermin start
	fi
After the usermin service is started, point your web browser to 
http://localhost:20000 and login as root to use usermin.
