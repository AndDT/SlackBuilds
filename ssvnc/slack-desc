ssvnc: ssvnc (The Enhanced TightVNC Viewer)
ssvnc:
ssvnc: The Enhanced TightVNC Viewer package started as a project to add some
ssvnc: patches to the long neglected Unix TightVNC Viewer. However, now the
ssvnc: front-end GUI, encryption, and wrapper scripts features possibly
ssvnc: outweigh the Unix TightVNC Viewer improvements.
ssvnc:
ssvnc: The SSVNC Unix vncviewer can also be run without the SSVNC encryption
ssvnc: GUI as an enhanced replacement for the xvncviewer, xtightvncviewer,
ssvnc: etc., viewers.
