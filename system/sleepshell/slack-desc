# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sleepshell: sleepshell (Sleep Dummy Shell)
sleepshell:
sleepshell: This is a simple do-nothing, sleep-forever program that can be used
sleepshell: as a login shell (in Linux or Unix) to keep the connection open but
sleepshell: without interactive shell. We use it to create SSH accounts for users
sleepshell: who will only use them for SSH-tunneling; to create an encrypted
sleepshell: tunnel to our servers (for example to connect securely to database
sleepshell: servers like mySQL, PostgreSQL, etc).
