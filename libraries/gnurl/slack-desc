# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gnurl: The goal for libgnurl is to support only HTTP and HTTPS (and only
gnurl: HTTP 1.x) with a single crypto backend (GnuTLS) to ensure a small
gnurl: footprint and uniform experience for developers regardless of how
gnurl: libcurl was compiled.
